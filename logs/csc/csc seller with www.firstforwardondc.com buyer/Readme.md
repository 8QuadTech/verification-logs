# Logs for transaction between csc seller and www.firstforwardondc.com buyer 

# On /status  Request
Buyer app does not seem to have any way for the customer to initiate a **/status** request.
**NOTE**: The **/status** endpoint is being called by the buyer automatically at a later time, the request and response has now thus been included in the logs as captured. 

# On /update, /cancel Request

CSC Seller Items are **non-cancellable** and **non-returnable**, buyer app does not provide any provision to send request if items non-cancellable
